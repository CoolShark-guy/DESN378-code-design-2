## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
I learned what the concepts of what the pattern looks like to call back to elements in HTML from Javascript to add them to a function, and event listener. I also learned you can create functions instead of using the preset functions all the time. I understand the concepts of if, else statements, but I just need more practice typing them out and putting them to practice.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Often times it was just two lines of code conflicting with each other, but using AI to clear this stopgap really sped up the process.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used Claude to help me troubleshoot my code by giving it my behavioral-layer files and having it identify conflictions in my code. I also used to to help me learn the code line by line. (I love Claude for coding)
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I think I just need more repitition with the concepts taught in week 0 here, i.e. event listener, functions, setting inputs to local storage, or not doing so using "!" and so on.
