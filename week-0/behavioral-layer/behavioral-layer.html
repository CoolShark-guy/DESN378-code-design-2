    <p>Just kidding.</p>
    <p>My Name is Fabian, and I'm a graphic designer studying at EWU</p>
    <p> My current interests are... </p>

    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>Animation</li>
      <li>Learning to Draw</li>
      <li>Web Design</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Click on the list ^ you can cross it off.</h3>

    <p>I love making stuff that is impactful to the consumer, and I see that there are a lot of websites nowadays that are the same copy and paste and just feel soulless (I'll update this website too). I wanna make fun functional websites and animations! So if you ever see my name on the big screen or in the credits of a website somwhere. Just know I made it!</p>
